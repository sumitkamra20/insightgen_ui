## Headline:
Saigon Beer's significant growth among SEC C on Brand Power is driven by all three levers in the long run, with Meaning and Salience fueling short-term gains—putting pressure on declining Tiger and Heineken. Tiger's decline in SEC C is more pronounced in the long run due to weakening Difference and Salience
